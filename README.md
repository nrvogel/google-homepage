This is my first ever attempt at creating a webpage. I looked up other student contributions and the google homepage code on devtools in Chrome to help me. It was a learning experience and helped me obtain a greater understanding of how HTML and CSS work together. Obviously, being my first webpage project, I had no clue what I was doing and I don't know all the tags, elements, attributes, etc. That will come with time and doing it over and over again. This is the beginning!
